An app based on the course *Ionic 2 the Practical Guide to Building iOS Android Apps* from Udemy ministred by Maximilian.

The objective of this app is learn more about the basis of Ionic. Evertything used here is from the Ionic documentation page and from the [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller guide in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/learn/v4/overview).

This app is ready for Android debug deploy (not tested with iOS).

With the time, I will put some extra features to this app, as I learn some with the next apps from Max.

Stay tunned.
